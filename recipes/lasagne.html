    <li>100g (3.5 oz) Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</strong> Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Sauté the onion, carrot, and celery until soft. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef (and pork if using) and cook until browned. Pour in the red wine (if using) and let it evaporate.</li>
    <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and beef broth. Simmer on low heat for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the Béchamel Sauce:</strong> In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the milk, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Cook until thickened. Season with salt and nutmeg, then set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong> Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
    <li>Layer lasagna sheets, followed by more meat sauce, béchamel sauce, and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with béchamel and cheese on top.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes until golden and bubbling.</li>
    <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
