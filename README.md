# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It is a simple recipe website that will demonstrate my skills in basic HTML, including:
- Structuring a webpage
- Creating links between pages
- Using lists and images

By the end of this project, I will have a better understanding of HTML fundamentals.
